# Kubernetes template function

These files are copied from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/tree/master/pkg/util/templates to make cobra output prettier.

If not copying them it would pull in entire kubernetes and increase binary by 15mb. So it is easier to just include those files directly in code.
